<p>"Welcome to the University of New Haven, a vibrant and welcoming community in the heart of New England.

Within our distinctive colleges and schools, students find dynamic, responsive, engaging, and pragmatic paths of discovery across a wide variety of programs and disciplines. There are more than 100 academic programs to choose from, all grounded in a longstanding commitment to collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based learning.

Our colleges and schools are at the center of University life, and that’s where we lay the foundation for future scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, forensic psychologists, doctors, engineers, programmers, attorneys, and scholars – soon-to-be global citizens who, before long, will take their places in the world."  </p>
